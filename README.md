# 📧 Advanced Automation with Make – Email Classification and Attachment Management

This repository contains the final project for the **Advanced Automations with Make** module.  
The objective of the project is to design a **realistic, coherent, and maintainable automation system** that combines traditional automation logic with advanced Make modules.

The system automates **email classification**, **attachment management in Google Drive**, and **data visualization in Airtable**, with a strong focus on usability for non-technical users.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Design and document a multi-scenario automation system in Make that:

- Automatically classifies incoming emails
- Processes and stores email attachments in an organized way
- Centralizes relevant information in Airtable
- Uses conditional logic, routers, and aggregators
- Reflects a professional, real-world automation use case

---

## 🧩 Included Scenarios

### 1. Email classification and attachment processing
- Detects unread emails in Gmail
- Classifies emails based on subject and content
- Moves emails to the appropriate label
- Downloads and filters relevant attachments
- Uploads files to Google Drive
- Stores key information in Airtable

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Make (Integromat)**
- **Gmail**
- **Google Drive**
- **Airtable**

---

## 📄 Blueprint

The Make scenario blueprint is available in the `blueprints/` folder and can be imported directly into Make.

---

## 👤 End User

The end user **does not interact with Make**.  
All relevant information is displayed exclusively in **Airtable**, using a human-readable format.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The automation is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind  
- Internal Make complexity is intentionally hidden from the end user  
- The project prioritizes clarity, structure, and real-world applicability
